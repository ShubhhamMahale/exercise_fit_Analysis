# Fitness Analysis

## Overview
The Fitness Analysis project, a capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Course, utilizes Power BI for visualization and R for data processing and analysis. Leveraging the Bellabeat dataset, it includes daily exercise and activity data, daily and hourly calories burned, heart rate per second, sleep data, weight loss data, and more.

  -  Displays the average heart rate of all users on a daily basis, with Monday having the second-highest heart rate and Sunday being the lowest. Saturday peaked with almost 80 HBPS on average.
  -  Additionally, it illustrates that HBPS reached its lowest at 3 o'clock and its highest at 9 o'clock.
  -  Furthermore, it showcases the relationship between steps and distance, sleep time and active time, as well as sleep time and calories burned using scatter charts.
  -  A pie chart is also used to determine the percentage of different types of users.

  -  Shows the relationship between calories and other attributes such as total steps, distance, and total active time.
  -  Additionally, it displays the average calories burned on a daily basis and hourly basis, along with a line chart depicting the maximum and minimum heart rate for each hour of the day.
    
## Features
- **Data Processing**: R is used for data processing and analysis, ensuring data accuracy and reliability.
- **Visualization**: Power BI creates an interactive dashboard with various visualizations for insightful analysis.
- **Hourly Heart Rate Analysis**: Graphical representation of average heart rate per second (HRPS) throughout the day and week.
- **User Activity**: Pie chart showcasing the distribution of user activity levels (e.g., fairly active, sedentary) among total users.
- **Steps Analysis**: Visualizes average, maximum, and minimum steps taken by users.
- **Sleep and Activity**: Scatter chart illustrating the relationship between total sleep time and activity time.
- **Sleep and Calorie Burn**: Scatter chart demonstrating the relationship between total sleep time and calories burned.
- **Steps and Distance**: Scatter chart displaying the correlation between steps taken and distance covered.

## Usage
1. **Data Processing**: Use R scripts to preprocess and analyze the Bellabeat dataset.
2. **Visualization**: Import processed data into Power BI to create the interactive dashboard.
3. **Exploration**: Utilize the dashboard to explore various insights such as hourly heart rate patterns, user activity distribution, steps analysis, and correlations between sleep, activity, calories burned, steps, and distance covered.

## Questions that can be answered

1. **What is the average daily heart rate for all users, and how does it vary throughout the week?**
2. **Which day of the week exhibits the highest and lowest average heart rate, and how significant are these differences?**
3. **At what time of day do heart rates typically peak and reach their lowest?**
4. **How does the amount of sleep correlate with activity levels and calories burned?**
5. **What is the relationship between steps taken and the distance covered by users?**
6. **What percentage of users fall into different activity categories (e.g., sedentary, very active), and how does this distribution affect overall trends?**
